The quantum eraser experiment is a variation of Thomas Young's classic double-slit 
experiment. It establishes that when action is taken to determine which of 2 
slits a photon has passed through, the photon cannot interfere with itself. 
When a stream of photons is marked in this way, then the interference fringes 
characteristic of the Young experiment will not be seen. The experiment also 
creates situations in which a photon that has been "marked" to reveal through 
which slit it has passed can later be "unmarked." A photon that has been "marked" 
cannot interfere with itself and will not produce fringe patterns, 
but a photon that has been "marked" and then "unmarked" will interfere with itself 
and produce the fringes characteristic of Young's experiment.
