According to the Copenhagen interpretation, material objects, on a microscopic level, generally 
do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict 
the probability distribution of a given measurement's possible results. The act of measurement 
affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values 
immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as wave function collapse.
